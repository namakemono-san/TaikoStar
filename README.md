# TaikoStaRPC

This is a mod for Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This mod was originally made by Namakemono-san. I simply forked it and removed features, whilst keeping only the RPC aspect of the mod.
> I also modified some aspects of the RPC: Namely, instead of putting the Genre in the second line it'll be the subtitle. The genre is now the big picture thingy.
